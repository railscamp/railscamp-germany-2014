        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>What is it?</strong><br/>
            <p>A community-organized and non-profit (un)conference/barcamp with talks and workshops about web development, but also many fun non-tech activities.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>When and where will it take place?</strong><br/>
            <p>The camp warm-up already <strong>starts Friday September 26 at 19:00</strong>, while the sessions start on Saturday morning at 10:30.  It <strong>ends Sunday September 28 at 17:00</strong>.  The <a href="/venue/"><strong>Abenteuerhallen Kalk (Cologne)</strong></a> are a unique and quirky place with lots of room for all kinds of activity.  There will be food, drinks and room to sleep, so you will never have to leave the venue for the whole weekend.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Who is attending?</strong><br />
            <p>There will be <strong>100-200 fun-loving techies</strong> who have some interest in Rails and web development, and who like to meet new people.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>What will the sessions be about?</strong><br />
            <p>The event originated in the Rails community, but hardly any session is limited to Ruby/Rails.  There will be general <strong>frontend topics</strong> (Living Styleguides, ember), generic <strong>backend topics</strong> (CoreOS, Docker, InfluxDB), <strong>soft skills</strong> (Design Thinking), and most of all many <strong>non-tech activities</strong> (climbing, screen printing, sewing, socccer, ...)</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Who is behind this event?</strong><br />
            <p>The organization behind the event is the <strong>non-profit Ruby Berlin e.V</strong>.  The core organizers are a loose group of <strong>volunteers</strong>, who like to bring together the German Rails community.  But at the end it is <strong>you</strong>, your contributions, your help, your sessions, that will make this event awesome.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>What is expected of me as a participant?</strong><br />
            <p><strong>Everybody</strong> at Railscamp is also a </strong>speaker</strong> (and maybe even <strong>organizer</strong>) at the same time.  It's an event "by the communtiy, for the community".  If you would like something at the event, just <strong>take matters in your own hands</strong> and make it happen, you will surely find others to help you.</p>
