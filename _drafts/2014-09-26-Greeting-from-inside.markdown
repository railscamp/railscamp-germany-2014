# Some personal words on RailsCamp

RailsCamp Germany 2014 is finally happening. As I cannot attend this year,
I'd like to say a few words.

The RailsCamp Germany has always been an important cornerstone of the
Ruby community and last years "revival" was one of the best events I've
ever been to. I loved that it took the idea of an event centered
about community involvement to a maximum and provides a very
rememberable space to practice it.

The german Ruby community is incredibly creative when it comes to creating
special events. It has understood that we meet because of technology, but that
community goes beyond this. There is a need for meetings that provide something
else than talks seperated by short breaks. Spaces for creating and free time
together is very important. Traditionally, those spaces are just local, but
events like RailsCamp expand the reach.

It's no surprise that a lot of the discussions that happened during the last
years RailsCamp rendition influenced this years work of the Ruby Berlin e.V..
While some of them haven't seen the light of day, others were implemented, for
example a clarification in the statutes that Ruby Berlin e.V. supports projects
all over Europe. We are proud to provide our services the team again. We are
very interested to see what comes out this year.

I'd like to take the chance to thank everyone actively involved in
both the german and the international Ruby community for their hard work,
usually for free and on their spare time. A lot of good work comes out of it.
If you see someone involved in any of those projects at the camp, please consider
showing them your gratitude in some way.

And finally, I'd like to thank everyone who attends these events and supports
them! Have a lot of fun at RailsCamp and don't break a leg in the halfpipe!
