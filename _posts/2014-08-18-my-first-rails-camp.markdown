**English version**

Last year was my first RailsCamp and it was an overwhelming feeling meeting the community. At first point I realized that the sessions where not as Rails specific as one could expect. I had the feeling of doing more fun-sport tracks and socializing with lot of people from different backgrounds.

This year I definitely won't miss the climbing session because I’ll be giving the session. So hoping to meet you there.

I also wasn't at the freakiest session: the BMX riding with the broken teeth and bloody legs it caused. (will there be a session II ?) I don’t know if there will be the power-workout with 5km running experience at almost 100°F/38°C (which I joined) - but if, I promise it won’t be as hot as last year.

We had also an incredible BBQ event and as I heard this year there will be more vegetarian food!

Side note: Don’t forget your last year RFID tracking card. This year we will reopen the check-ins on different places. Perhaps someone will come up with some gamification idea?
Here you see the checkin on the beverage lane:
